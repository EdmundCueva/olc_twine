Let's try this one more time.

[[1. The pharaoh has broad shoulders, a low small of the back, and thick limbs with musculature. He has round, full cheeks, a short nose with pronounced nostril wings, prominent lips, a short chin, with a thick, short neck rising vertically from the shoulders.]]


[[2. Although the pharaoh is depicted with elongated and exaggerated features, his appearance is very naturalistic, emphasizing a sense of space and movement.]]

''(text-colour:navy)[Correct! The description is from a sunk relief from a temple at Amarna depicting the pharaoh Akhenaten.]''

:: Akhenaten and Art {"position":"100,400","size":"100,100"}
[(text-colour:orange)[In addition to displacing the traditional Egyptian pantheon (Isis, Osiris, Bastet, etc.) with quasi-monotheism and moving the capital of Egypt from ancient Thebes to an uninhabited area, the radical pharaoh Akhenaten introduced a new type of art that depicted the human body in a more representative, realistic, and expressionistic manner that broke away from the idealized depictions of the human body created before and after his rule.

Which city would you visit to find where Akhenaten introduced a new art style] ]


[[Amarna]]

[[Luxor]]

[[Thebes]]


:: Amarna {"position":"300,400","size":"100,100"}
(text-colour:orange)[Correct! Great work! 

Let's continue our exploration of Amarnan art! 

Select the passage below that you think describes art created during Akhenaten's new reign.]

[[1. The pharaoh has broad shoulders, a low small of the back, and thick limbs with musculature. He has round, full cheeks, a short nose with pronounced nostril wings, prominent lips, a short chin, with a thick, short neck rising vertically from the shoulders.]]


[[2. Although the pharaoh is depicted with elongated and exaggerated features, his appearance is very naturalistic, emphasizing a sense of space and movement.]]


:: CHOOSE ME! I'M AMARNAN. {"position":"700,300","size":"100,100"}
(text-colour:green)[Correct! Excellent work! The image depicts Akhenaten and his wife Nefertitti with three of theri daughters under the rays of the Aten.


Let's try another set of comparisons. Choose the non-Amarnan art.]

[[NO! CHOOSE ME!]]


:: NO! PICK ME! {"position":"900,500","size":"100,100"}
(text-colour:cyan)[Incorrect! This is a stela that dates to the 12th Dynasty. It is located at the British Museum, which supplies this description:

The relief shows the sculptor "Userwer and his wife Satdepetnetjer and (far right) Userwer’s parents."

"The stela contains a supplication to those who see it to make offerings. The upper of the two scenes shows (left) Userwer and his wife Satdepetnetjer seated before offerings. Beside them is Satameni, another wife of Userwer. It is likely that Userwer married one after the other’s death, rather than being married to both at the same time. Userwer’s parents are shown to the right, and his children below. It is not certain where this stela came from, although, like many others, it might have been set up at Abydos near the cult centre of Osiris, the god of the dead."]


:: PICK ME {"position":"900,300","size":"100,100"}
(text-colour:cyan)[Incorrect! This is a relief of a Theban family that dates to the 19th Dynasty (710-670 BC). It is located at the Brookly Museum, which supplies this description:

The relief "shows Amun-Re and Mut. Because the two scenes are comparable though reversed, it seems likely that Amun-Re and Mut faced another God's Wife of Amun. The shallow sunk relief and the treatment of the faces are typical of Twenty-fifth Dynasty reliefs found on the small chapels in Thebes."]


:: Thebes {"position":"200,300","size":"100,100"}
(text-colour:red)[Incorrect, Thebes is the old capital that Akhenaten abandoned as part of his radical new reign.
